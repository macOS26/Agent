## The Problem

You're a developer on macOS. You want AI assistance that:
- **Actually controls your apps** — not just generates text
- **Builds your Xcode projects** — not just reads files
- **Runs native scripts** — Swift, AppleScript, JavaScript
- **Respects your privacy** — runs locally when you want
- **Uses your preferred LLM** — Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, local models

**Every other AI tool fails at this.** They're terminal-focused, web-first, or Windows-centric. They don't understand Apple's ecosystem.

---

## The Solution: Agent!

Agent! is a **native macOS SwiftUI application** designed from the ground up for Apple's ecosystem. It's not a terminal wrapper. It's not an Electron app. It's a first-class macOS citizen.

### What Makes Agent! Different

To use vision features, simply include images in your conversation with a vision-capable model.

### 🦾 AgentScript — Swift at Runtime

Write **100% Swift scripts** that compile at runtime and run with full system access:

```swift
// ~/Documents/AgentScript/agents/Sources/Scripts/MyScript.swift
import Foundation
import MusicBridge

@_cdecl("script_main")
public func scriptMain() -> Int32 {
    let music = SBApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.Music")!
    let track = music.currentTrack!
    print("Now playing: \(track.name ?? "Unknown")")
    return 0
}
```

**No other AI tool can do this.** AgentScript dylibs load via `dlopen()` and have full access to:
- ScriptingBridge (Music, Finder, Mail, Calendar, etc.)
- Foundation networking and file I/O
- CoreGraphics for screenshots
- AVFoundation for audio/video
- Security framework for keychain access

### 📱 Messages Monitor — Remote Control via iMessage

Control your Mac from anywhere using iMessage:

```
[From your iPhone]
Agent! What song is playing?
Agent! Build my Xcode project
Agent! Check my email
```

Agent! responds with results directly to your iMessage. **Approved contacts only** — you control who can send commands.

### 🛠️ 60+ Built-in Tools

Agent! includes a comprehensive toolset:

<details>
<summary><strong>Direct Tools (no action parameter)</strong></summary>

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents with line numbers |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite files |
| `edit_file` | Exact string replacement in files |
| `diff_and_apply` | Line-range editing with preview |

| `batch_tools` | Multiple tool calls in one request |

</details>

### 📝 D1F MultiLineDiff Capability

Agent! uses the **D1F MultiLineDiff library** for powerful and safe file editing operations. This advanced diff engine provides:

#### How It Works

D1F (Delta-1-Format) uses a specialized format for representing file changes:

```
=  Keep line unchanged
-  Remove line
+  Add new line
```

This format allows for precise, multi-line edits with built-in verification:

```
=== Original File ===
1: func calculate() {
2:     let x = 10
3:     return x * 2
4: }

=== D1F Diff ===
= func calculate() {
-     let x = 10
+     let x = 20
=     return x * 2
= }

=== Result ===
1: func calculate() {
2:     let x = 20
3:     return x * 2
4: }
```

#### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SHA Verification** | Every diff includes SHA hash for change verification |
| **Line-Number Tracking** | Automatic line number adjustment after edits |
| **Undo Support** | Diffs are reversible — undo any change |
| **Preview Mode** | See changes before applying with `create_diff` |
| **Multi-Line Edits** | Replace entire blocks of code safely |
| **Context Preservation** | Maintains surrounding code structure |

#### Available Diff Tools

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `edit_file` | Simple string replacement (old_string → new_string) |
| `diff_and_apply` | Line-range editing with preview (one-shot) |
| `create_diff` | Preview changes before committing |
| `apply_diff` | Apply a created or inline D1F diff |
| `undo_edit` | Reverse a previous diff by ID |

#### Example Workflow

```swift
// Step 1: Create a preview diff
create_diff(file_path: "/src/Main.swift", start_line: 10, end_line: 15, 
            destination: "new code here")
// Returns: diff_id for review

// Step 2: Review the preview
// D1F shows exactly what changes with =/-/+ markers

// Step 3: Apply if correct
apply_diff(file_path: "/src/Main.swift", diff_id: "uuid-here")

// Step 4: Need to undo? 
undo_edit(file_path: "/src/Main.swift", diff_id: "uuid-here")
```

#### Safety Benefits

- **No accidental overwrites** — SHA verification ensures changes match expectations
- **Atomic operations** — Each edit is self-contained
- **Full audit trail** — Every change is logged with its diff
- **Reversible** — Any edit can be undone with the diff_id

## AgentScript Deep Dive

### Why AgentScript?

AgentScript solves a fundamental problem: **existing AI tools cannot control macOS apps directly**. They can:
- Generate text
- Edit files
- Run terminal commands

But they **cannot**:
- Control Xcode, Music, Finder, or any macOS app
- Capture screenshots with native APIs
- Respond to system events
- Run with full TCC permissions

AgentScript fixes this by compiling **Swift to dynamic libraries** that load at runtime with full system access.

### How It Works

```
1. User creates script: ~/Documents/AgentScript/agents/Sources/Scripts/MyScript.swift

2. ScriptService.ensurePackage():
   - Discovers all .swift files in Sources/Scripts/
   - Parses import statements for bridge dependencies
   - Generates Package.swift with correct dependencies

3. User runs script:
   - ScriptService.compileAllScripts()
   - swift build (produces .dylib)
   - dlopen() loads dylib into memory
   - dlsym() finds script_main symbol
   - Script executes with @_cdecl calling convention

4. Return value:
   - 0 = success
   - Non-zero = error (logged, returned to LLM)
```

### Bridge Modules

Agent! includes **50+ ScriptingBridge bridges** for app automation:

| Bridge | App |
|--------|-----|
| MusicBridge | Apple Music |
| FinderBridge | Finder |
| MailBridge | Mail |
| CalendarBridge | Calendar |
| ContactsBridge | Contacts |
| SafariBridge | Safari |
| ChromeBridge | Google Chrome |
| FirefoxBridge | Firefox |
| MessagesBridge | Messages |
| NotesBridge | Notes |
| XcodeScriptingBridge | Xcode |
| TerminalBridge | Terminal |
| SystemEventsBridge | System Events |
| ... | 40+ more |

### Example Scripts

<details>
<summary><strong>Screenshot Capture</strong></summary>

```swift
import CoreGraphics
import Foundation
import AppKit

@_cdecl("script_main")
public func scriptMain() -> Int32 {
    guard let cgImage = CGWindowListCreateImage(
        CGRect.null,
        .optionOnScreenOnly,
        CGWindowID(kCGNullWindowID),
        [.boundsIgnoreFraming, .bestResolution]
    ) else {
        print("Failed to capture screen")
        return 1
    }
    
    let nsImage = NSImage(cgImage: cgImage, size: NSSize(width: cgImage.width, height: cgImage.height))
    guard let tiffData = nsImage.tiffRepresentation,
          let bitmap = NSBitmapImageRep(data: tiffData),
          let pngData = bitmap.representation(using: .png, properties: [:]) else {
        print("Failed to create PNG")
        return 1
    }
    
    let path = "/tmp/screenshot_\(Date().timeIntervalSince1970).png"
    try? pngData.write(to: URL(fileURLWithPath: path))
    print(path)
    return 0
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Music Control</strong></summary>

```swift
import Foundation
import MusicBridge

@_cdecl("script_main")
public func scriptMain() -> Int32 {
    guard let music = SBApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.Music") else {
        print("Music app not running")
        return 1
    }
    
    // Get current track
    if let track = music.currentTrack {
        print("Now playing: \(track.name ?? "Unknown")")
        print("Artist: \(track.artist ?? "Unknown")")
        print("Album: \(track.album ?? "Unknown")")
    }
    
    // Next track
    music.nextTrack?()
    
    return 0
}
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### What is MCP?

MCP is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. Agent! implements the full MCP specification.

### Supported Transports

| Transport | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Stdio** | Local MCP servers launched as subprocesses |
| **HTTP/SSE** | Remote MCP servers, cloud services |

### Configuration

MCP servers are configured in `~/Documents/AgentScript/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "name": "filesystem",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-filesystem",
      "args": ["/Users/toddbruss/projects"],
      "env": {},
      "enabled": true,
      "autoStart": true
    },
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
      "name": "github",
      "url": "https://mcp.github.com/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
      },
      "enabled": true,
      "autoStart": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Messages Monitor

### Remote Control via iMessage

Agent! can receive commands via iMessage from approved contacts:

1. **Enable Messages** in the toolbar (green switch)
2. **Open Messages Monitor** (speech bubble icon)
3. **Approve contacts** by toggling them ON
4. **Send commands** from your iPhone or other device:

```
Agent! What song is playing?
Agent! Build and run my Xcode project
Agent! Check my email for messages from John
Agent! Create a git commit with message "Fix bug"
```

### Security

- **Only approved contacts** can execute commands
- **256 character limit** on responses (iMessage constraint)
- **All commands logged** in activity history
- **Automatic timeout** for long-running tasks

---

## Apple Intelligence Integration — C3PO Moderator/Translator

Agent! integrates with **Apple Intelligence (macOS 26+)** as a **C3PO Moderator/Translator** — named after the Star Wars protocol droid known for translation and etiquette. Like C-3PO, Apple Intelligence serves as an intermediary that:

1. **Moderates** — Acts as a smart intermediary between the user and the primary LLM
2. **Translates** — Rephrases and clarifies user requests to improve LLM understanding
3. **Mediates Context** — Helps translate user intent into well-structured prompts
4. **LoRA Training** — Optionally captures training data for fine-tuning models

### Why C3PO?

Just as C-3PO was fluent in over 6 million forms of communication, Apple Intelligence helps bridge the gap between human intent and machine understanding:

| C-3PO Role | Apple Intelligence Role |
|------------|------------------------|
| Translator | Rephrases user requests for clarity |
| Protocol Droid | Ensures proper communication format |
| Mediator | Bridges user intent and LLM understanding |
| Advisor | Provides context-aware suggestions |

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   User      │ ───▶ │ C3PO (Apple     │ ───▶ │  Primary    │
│   Request   │      │ Intelligence)   │      │  LLM        │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                     ┌─────────────────┐
                     │ • Clarifies     │
                     │ • Rephrases     │
                     │ • Adds Context  │
                     │ • Translates    │
                     └─────────────────┘
```

### Enabling C3PO (Apple Intelligence)

1. Open **System Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri**
2. Enable Apple Intelligence
3. In Agent!, open Settings → Apple Intelligence
4. Toggle **Enable Mediator (C3PO)**
5. Optionally enable **Training Mode** to capture LoRA data

### Benefits of C3PO Mode

- **Better Understanding** — Apple Intelligence rephrases ambiguous requests
- **Context Preservation** — Maintains conversation context across messages
- **Intent Clarification** — Helps when user requests are unclear
- **Privacy-First** — All processing happens on-device with Apple Silicon

### Writing Swift Agents with ScriptingBridge

Agent! can create **compiled Swift agents** that control macOS apps via ScriptingBridge:

#### How It Works

1. **Agent! analyzes your request** — "Control Music to play my workout playlist"
2. **Generates Swift code** using the appropriate bridge modules
3. **Compiles to dylib** at runtime
4. **Executes with full TCC permissions**

#### Example: Music Control Agent

```swift
// Agent! generates this automatically
import Foundation
import MusicBridge

@_cdecl("script_main")
public func scriptMain() -> Int32 {
    guard let music = SBApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.Music") else {
        print("Music not available")
        return 1
    }
    
    // Find and play playlist
    let playlists = music.sources?[0].playlists ?? []
    for playlist in playlists {
        if playlist.name == "Workout" {
            playlist.play?()
            return 0
        }
    }
    
    return 0
}
```

#### Supported ScriptingBridge Bridges

| **NotesBridge** | Notes | Create, read, modify notes |
| **XcodeScriptingBridge** | Xcode | Build, run, schemes |
| **TerminalBridge** | Terminal | Execute commands, tabs |
| **SystemEventsBridge** | System Events | UI scripting, processes |

**Plus 40+ more bridges** for macOS apps.

### Writing AppleScript Agents

For apps without ScriptingBridge support or for GUI automation, Agent! generates **AppleScript**:

```applescript
-- Agent! generates this automatically
tell application "Finder"
    set theFiles to every file of folder "Documents"
    repeat with aFile in theFiles
        if name extension of aFile is "pdf" then
            move aFile to folder "PDFs"
        end if
    end repeat
end tell
```

#### AppleScript Tool Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `execute` | Run inline AppleScript source code |
| `lookup_sdef` | Read an app's scripting dictionary |
| `list` | List saved AppleScripts |
| `run` | Run a saved script by name |
| `save` | Save a script for reuse |
| `delete` | Remove a saved script |

#### Example: GUI Automation with AppleScript

```applescript
-- Agent! generates this for UI automation
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Safari"
        click menu item "New Window" of menu "File" of menu bar 1
        delay 1
        keystroke "t" using {command down}
    end tell
end tell
```

### Writing JavaScript (JXA) Agents

Agent! supports **JavaScript for Automation (JXA)** for JavaScript-native automation:

```javascript
// Agent! generates this automatically
const safari = Application('Safari');
safari.activate();

const tab = safari.Document().make();
safari.windows[0].currentTab.url = 'https://github.com';
```

#### JavaScript Tool Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `execute` | Run inline JXA source code |
| `list` | List saved JXA scripts |
| `run` | Run a saved script by name |
| `save` | Save a script for reuse |
| `delete` | Remove a saved script |

### Web Automation — HTML Page Control

Agent! can automate **most HTML webpages** including Google Search, GitHub, and more. The `web` tool provides comprehensive browser control:

#### Web Tool Actions

| Action | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `open` | Open a URL | `web(action: "open", url: "https://google.com")` |
| `google_search` | Search Google | `web(action: "google_search", query: "Swift tutorials")` |
| `click` | Click an element | `web(action: "click", selector: "#submit-button")` |
| `type` | Type text into input | `web(action: "type", selector: "input[name='q']", text: "hello")` |
| `read_content` | Extract page content | `web(action: "read_content")` |
| `execute_js` | Run JavaScript | `web(action: "execute_js", script: "document.title")` |
| `get_url` | Get current URL | `web(action: "get_url")` |
| `get_title` | Get page title | `web(action: "get_title")` |
| `find` | Find elements | `web(action: "find", selector: ".result")` |
| `scroll_to` | Scroll to element | `web(action: "scroll_to", selector: "#footer")` |
| `select` | Select dropdown option | `web(action: "select", selector: "select", value: "option1")` |
| `submit` | Submit a form | `web(action: "submit", selector: "form")` |
| `navigate` | Navigate back/forward | `web(action: "navigate", direction: "back")` |
| `list_tabs` | List open tabs | `web(action: "list_tabs")` |
| `switch_tab` | Switch to tab | `web(action: "switch_tab", index: 2)` |
| `list_windows` | List browser windows | `web(action: "list_windows")` |
| `new_window` | Open new window | `web(action: "new_window")` |
| `close_window` | Close window | `web(action: "close_window")` |

#### Example: Google Search and Data Extraction

Agent! can autonomously:
1. Open Google Search
2. Enter a search query
3. Navigate results
4. Extract data from result pages

```swift
// Step 1: Open Google
web(action: "open", url: "https://google.com")

// Step 2: Type search query
web(action: "type", selector: "input[name='q']", text: "best Swift UI tutorials")

// Step 3: Submit search
web(action: "submit", selector: "form")

// Step 4: Wait and read results
web(action: "read_content")  // Returns page content

// Step 5: Extract specific data
web(action: "execute_js", script: """
    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.g a'))
         .map(a => ({ title: a.innerText, url: a.href }))
""")
```

#### Example: GitHub Repository Analysis

```swift
// Open a repository
web(action: "open", url: "https://github.com/toddbruss/Agent")

// Get repository stats
web(action: "execute_js", script: """
    ({
        stars: document.querySelector('[href="/toddbruss/Agent/stargazers"]').innerText,
        forks: document.querySelector('[href="/toddbruss/Agent/forks"]').innerText,
        watchers: document.querySelector('[href="/toddbruss/Agent/watchers"]').innerText
    })
""")

// Navigate to issues
web(action: "click", selector: 'a[href="/toddbruss/Agent/issues"]')

// List all open issues
web(action: "read_content")
```

#### Safari Deep Integration

Safari has the deepest integration because it supports **AppleScript JavaScript execution**:

```applescript
-- Execute JavaScript in Safari via AppleScript
tell application "Safari"
    tell front document
        do JavaScript "document.querySelectorAll('.price').map(e => e.innerText)"
    end tell
end tell
```

This enables:
- **Form filling** — Auto-fill complex forms
- **Data scraping** — Extract structured data from pages
- **UI testing** — Click, type, verify page state
- **Content extraction** — Pull article text, prices, tables
- **Navigation automation** — Complex multi-page workflows

#### Workflow Example: Research Assistant

```
User: "Research the top 5 Swift UI libraries and summarize them"

Agent!:
1. Opens Google Search
2. Searches "Swift UI libraries"
3. Reads result titles and snippets
4. Opens top 5 results
5. Extracts key information from each page
6. Compiles a summary

All automated — no manual browsing required.
```

### Combining Self-Writing Agents with Web Automation

Agent! can combine all three automation types:

```swift
// Agent! generates a complete workflow:

// 1. Swift AgentScript for file operations
@_cdecl("script_main")
public func scriptMain() -> Int32 {
    // Create directory for scraped data
    try! FileManager.default.createDirectory(
        at: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/tmp/scraped"),
        withIntermediateDirectories: true
    )
    return 0
}

// 2. Web automation for data collection
// Opens URLs, extracts data, saves results

// 3. AppleScript to organize results
tell application "Finder"
    set theFolder to folder "/tmp/scraped"
    sort files of theFolder by name
end tell
```

### Why This Matters

| Feature | Agent! | Other AI Tools |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Write Swift scripts** | ✅ Compiles dylibs at runtime | ❌ Terminal only |
| **ScriptingBridge support** | ✅ 50+ app bridges | ❌ None |
| **AppleScript generation** | ✅ Native execution | ⚠️ Via MCP (add-on) |
| **JXA support** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ None |
| **Web automation** | ✅ Safari + partial Chrome/Firefox | ⚠️ Via Playwright add-on |
| **Self-writing agents** | ✅ Full autonomy | ❌ No agent system |
| **TCC permissions** | ✅ Full access | ❌ Sandboxed |
